# Horizon project template

This is a template to start your own project that uses Grunt and libsass!

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/): Install the 1.9.x branch
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`
  * [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php#windows): Install Win64 dynamic at 16 bits-per-pixel v.6.8.x or better

## Quickstart

Make sure you have bower and grunt-cli installed globally:

```bash
npm install -g bower grunt-cli
```

Then install project dependencies locally:

```bash
npm install
```

While you're working on your project, run:

`grunt`

And you're set!
